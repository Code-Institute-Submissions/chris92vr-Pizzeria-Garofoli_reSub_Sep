# Pizzeria Garofoli Website
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a responsive website for a traditional italian pizzeria. It's a front end site only and allows visitors to:
1.	Enter the atmosphere of the restaurant
2.	Reserve a table
3.	See the images in the gallery

## Demo

A demo of this site is available [here](https://chris92vr.github.io/Pizzeria-Garofoli).
 
## UX

#### User stories:

* As a user I would like to be able to view the Pizzeria internally.

### Strategy

My goal in the design was to recall the italian tradition to be able to easily access the basic contact information of the restaurant.

### Scope

This website is designed for people who want information about the pizzeria and in the event the possibility of being able to reserve a table. 
The main purpose of the site is to provide users with the presentation of the pizzeria in order to obtain new possible customers.

## Features

Each page features a responsive header divided into three, colored to look like the Italian flag. In the center an icon which recalls catering.
Under the flag there is a simple responsive navbar with the navigation elements on the right and the name of the pizzeria on the left.
Each page has a footer with contact information and social media icons.

##### Homepage

Contains a bootstrap carousel showing the interior view of the restaurant, with a description and a button to reserve a table.  

##### Reservation
In this page there is a responsive form in which you can reserve a table. It has been realized  with the bootstrapâ€™s class form-row.

##### Gallery
Contains grouped images sorted by using the bootstrap row class.

### Existing Features

- Header Navigation Bar - Exists on every page and allows users to simply browse the pages of the entire site.
- Footer Address and Contact Info - Exist on every page, very useful for users interested in more information.
- Footer Social Icons - Exist on every page and allows all users to access the social platforms that the restaurant uses.
- [Carousel](index.html) - Slideshow of three images with text box in which there is a button to reserve a table. Designed to capture the attention of a possible customer. 
- [Gallery](gallery.html) - Allows all visitors to the website to view images of the pizzeria and its dishes.
- [Reservation form](reservation.html) - Allows potential customers on the Reservation page to enter the information needed to reserve a table.

### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to implement the gallery by adding interactivity with javascript.

## Technologies Used

  -  HTML 5
  -  CSS 3
  -  [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)
        - The project uses Bootstrap4 to simplify the structure of the website and make the website responsive easily.
        - The project also uses BootstrapCDN to provide icons from [FontAwesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/)
  -  [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
     - The project uses its to reference Javascript needed for the responsive navbar.
  - [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/)
    - The project uses its to reference Javascript needed for the responsive navbar.
  -  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
          

## Testing

Several tests were carried out to verify the correct functioning of the project with positive results.
The functionality of the site is optimal. Any link and button is active and leads to the corresponding destination.
Browser compatibility is verified for Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Opera on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 19.10 operating systems. The responsiveness of the pages is suitable on desktop screens, tablets and mobile phones.
In the folder [projectdocumentation/screenshots](https://github.com/chris92vr/Pizzeria-Garofoli/tree/master/projectdocumentation/screenshots), there are screenshots that show browser compatibility and responsiveness tests.
Named screenshots, in the following format: (screen resolution) - operating system (browser) - page name.


In order to to check the validity of the website code, I have used the following:

    - HTML Validation: https://validator.w3.org/ - no errors identified.
    - CSS Validation: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ - Identified issues with bootstrap not with my project. 

#### Functionality Test
|Test Description | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail
| ---|:-----------------------------------------:| :---: | 
| interact with the navbar | each element (home, gallery, reserve a table!) must lead to the corresponding page| pass
| carousel buttons         | the right, left and indicators controls and "reserve a table!" buttons work as expected                                  | pass
| hover effect | hover effect on navbar, social link and reservation form works | pass
| form validation for required fields | the required fields (name, email, telephone, date, time and adult number) must be valid in order to send the form | pass
| social link | social links work, and open in a background tab | pass
| header image animation | the image in the center of the flag in the header is enlarged when the page is opened | pass
| responsivity | All pages must be displayed correctly on any screen resolution | pass
